Power BI report for Seven Sages Brewing Company

In this project, we create a data model and Power BI report for Seven Sages Brewing Company that combines information from all over the company. Our data model makes it possible for the company's CFO to quickly review and analyze what beers sell well and which ones generate the highest profitability.

We use PowerBI to combine and centralize data that was previously siloed, solving a very common issue facing many companies. More importantly, we also apply PowerBI key concepts to Get data, Transform data in Power Query, Create Date Table, Build Relationships, write Dax Measures and build a Report.


Main Steps
Here are the main steps.

- Source files. Download and familiarize yourself with the source files provided by SSBC.
- Sketch the data model. Sketch out the data model.
- Get and Transform data in Power Query
- Create date table. Create a date table to support time intelligence.
- Build relationships between tables. Build a relationship from each dimension to the relevant key on the fact table.
- Write Dax Measures. To satisfy the CFO's requirements, we will need to write six measures—to calculate Sales, Cost of Sales and Gross Profit Margin in two different currencies.
- Create a report. Build a basic visual report to display your findings.
