Power BI report for Seven Sages Brewing Company

This project focuses on creating a comprehensive Power BI report for Seven Sages Brewing Company, enabling the CFO to gain valuable insights into the company's sales performance and profitability. By combining and centralizing data from various sources, the report provides a holistic view of the business, highlighting top-selling beers and identifying the most profitable products.

Utilizing Power BI's key functionalities, we employ a structured approach to develop the report. The project begins with sourcing and familiarizing ourselves with the provided data files from Seven Sages Brewing Company. We then proceed to sketch out the data model, ensuring it captures all relevant information for analysis.

Using Power Query, we employ data transformation techniques to prepare and shape the data for analysis. This includes cleaning, filtering, and aggregating the data to derive meaningful insights. Furthermore, we create a date table to facilitate time-based analysis and build relationships between different tables to establish connections and enable seamless data exploration.

To meet the CFO's requirements, we write DAX measures that calculate crucial metrics such as Sales in USD ($), Cost of Sales in USD ($), and Gross Profit Margin (GPM) in USD (%). Additionally, considering the company's operations in multiple currencies, we incorporate measures to evaluate Sales in CAD ($) and analyze unit sales by product as a percentage.

Finally, we leverage Power BI's visualization capabilities to create a visually appealing and informative report. The report showcases sales performance, profitability, and the share of gross profit by product type, providing actionable insights for strategic decision-making.

Through this project, we demonstrate proficiency in data modeling, data transformation, DAX calculations, and report building using Power BI. The Power BI report enables Seven Sages Brewing Company to gain a comprehensive understanding of their sales and profitability, facilitating data-driven decision-making for sustainable business growth.
